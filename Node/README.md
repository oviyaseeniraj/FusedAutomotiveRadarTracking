Most code has been taken from Percept ([Multi-Node-App](https://github.com/Percept-2023-24/Multi-Node-App)), which built on top of Fusionsense ([Radar Pipeline](https://github.com/FusionSense/RadarPipeline) & [JetsonHardwareSetup](https://github.com/FusionSense/JetsonHardwareSetup)), and been refactored to be more readable and compatible with CMake.
